## A little about me

I'm currently in my last semester in my Computer Science major at the Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey (ITESM). I've worked in web development (with the React framework as well as Node.js). I'm interested in cybersecurity as well, I enjoy trying new pentesting tools as well as cryptography.
