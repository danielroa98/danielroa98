## A little about me

I'm currently in my 8th semester out of 9 in my Computer Science major at Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey (ITESM). I've worked in web development (more specifically React) and I'm learning to use _Vue_. I'm interested in working on the cybersecurity area, I like pentesting and cryptography.
