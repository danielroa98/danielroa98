## A little about me

I'm a graduate from Computer Science major at the Tecnológico de Monterrey (ITESM). I've worked in web development (with the React framework as well as Node.js). I'm interested in cybersecurity as well, I enjoy trying new pentesting tools as well as cryptography.

I enjoy learning from packages that I didn't that existed for Node.js and Python. I enjoy working the most with those languages as well as improving upon the knowledge that I already have of those two programming languages.
